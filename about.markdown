Hi There!  

My name is Anurag and I am an Azure Customer Engineer II at Microsoft, which means that I help developers using Azure and otherMicrosoft technologies/platforms to write better code and debug it efficiently and effectively, and learn A LOT on daily basis.

I mainly work with Azure, .NET and Data - for now, but I feel that the journey has just begun.

This blog is going to be mainly dedicated to share the learnings that I gain as the time passes, working with .NET, Data and other stuff. I used to use OneNote (an awesome product to use as a note keeper), but then I felt to share some of the learnings with everyone :-). Like the blog title says, this is to "Learn together & achieve more". And the journey continues...

**Contents are my own and provided as is.**  

Thank you,  
Anurag
